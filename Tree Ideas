Greatest Risk
-lasers not bouncing 
-chassis being too heavy to move

Mechanical
-CNC mill base for wheels to latch into
-weld 3 (#)-leg chassis, innermost is tallest outermost is shortest(cone shape)
-3 boxes spread out with the lasers inside, push a button on top to fire the laser(figure out audience voting/interaction at later date)
-wooden base(strong to support the whole structure)
-3 layers(electronics bin, wheel grid, chassis/branches)
-all branch wires in one slip ring 

Electronics
-2 arduinos
-bluetooth chip
-3 heavier motors
-lots of wire
-3 slip rings
-3 light sensors
-castors and heavy wheels for each chassis

Software
-bluetooth control tree movements
-4 sequences

Power
-big battery like Fritz, to go in bottom level with Arduinos

Parts List
-3 laser pointers
-smoke machine- if we can get rotating mirrors for laser show
-15 casters
-chicken wire to make branches

Schedule
-make chassis (need access to metal working shop)
-make wooden base(need access to wood shop)
-make chassis rotate
-get lasers to hit sensors for Reine

Things to Ask Michael For
-access to metal and wood shops
-laser mirrors
-big motors

Manual Override
-Handheld laser,  just aim for the sensor
